Distributed systems often require data and system updates to happen as quickly as possible
these updates can be handled with either messages or events.
1. With messages, updates are sent directly from one component to another to trigger an action.
2. With events, updates indicate that an action occurred at a specific time, and are not directed to a specific recipient.

An event is simply a record of something changing state. 
For example, the event of a credit card transaction includes the product purchased, the payment, the delivery, and the time of the purchase.
